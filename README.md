This C++ project is a Simple Banking Management System that allows users to manage client and user data. It's a console-based application designed to handle common banking operations.

Key Features:
Client Management: You can add new clients, view a list of all clients, and update, delete, or find specific client records. Client data, including account number, PIN code, name, phone, and balance, is stored in a clients.txt file.

Transaction Handling: You can make deposits, process withdrawals, and view the total balances of all clients.

User Management & Permissions: the system has a robust user management module. You can add new users with different access levels, update user information, delete users, and find specific user details. Each user can be assigned a unique combination of permissions, controlling their access to different parts of the application. User data is stored in a users.txt file.

Login & Authentication: The application starts with a login screen, requiring a valid username and password to proceed. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access the system's features.

Data Persistence: All client and user data is saved to text files, so the information remains intact even after the program is closed.
